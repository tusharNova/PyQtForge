## ⚡ Quickstart Example
- 1 Create a new project:
```bash
   pyqtforge createproject myapp
   cd myapp
```
- 2 Launch Qt Designer:
```bash
   pyqtforge createui mywindow
```
- 3 After designing, convert .ui to .py:
```bash
   pyqtforge ui2py ui/mywindow.ui
```
- 4 Edit your main.py to use the generated Python UI file:
```bash
   from PyQt5 import QtWidgets
   from views.mywindow import Ui_MainWindow
   
   class clsMainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
       def __init__(self):
           super(clsMainWindow , self).__init__()
           self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()
           self.ui.setupUi(self)
   
   app = QtWidgets.QApplication([])
   window = MainWindow()
   window.show()
   app.exec_()
